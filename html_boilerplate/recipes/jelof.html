                    <p>Laz-J's delicious pepper Soup is Nigerian's most popular evening recipes.</p>
                    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Catfish</li>
                        <li>Calabash nutmeg</li>
                        <li>salt</li>
                        <li>Sent leaf</li>
                        <li>seasonings</li>
                        <li>Bell pepper</li>
                        <li>Onion</li>
                        <li>Meat</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>We start by washing the fishes thoroughly, most people fail to do this properly. Normally, the fish is cut in the market by the seller to serve-able sizes so just transfer into a bowl and soak with hot water at 80 – 90 degree Celsius, very boiled water will end up peeling the skin of the fish.
                    <p> Wash to remove the slimy outer skin completely.</p></li>
                <li>Prepare all the necessary ingredients, I had to pound the fresh red pepper and half cup of crayfish together with a mortar and pestle. Also slice the utazi leaves, onions, scent leaves and set aside in bowls.</li>
                <li>Transfer the washed catfish into the cooking pot, as I advised above, it is better to use a small pot so the fish parts are very close to each other, this will allow the proper incorporation of the ingredients and help you make a very delicious point and kill pepper soup.<p>I think we are done with the hard part, fishes take about ten to fifteen minutes to cook, that is just the catfish. Electric fish and a few other fish found in Nigeria take just about five minutes to prepare.</p></li>
                <li>Once you have transferred into a pot, then start with salt, followed by seasoning cubes, fish seasoning, crayfish, pepper. etc.</li>
                <li>Thats it</li>
            </ol>

                    <p>Sylvo's delicious Edikaikong Soup is the real vegetable soup of the Ibibios or Efiks people of the South South region in Nigeria.</p>
                    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Water leaf</li>
                        <li>Pumpkin leaf</li>

                        <li>pepper, seasoning</li>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>When the meat is done, add a generous amount of palm oil, the crayfish and pepper and leave to boil for about 10 minutes. The palm oil serves as the liquid in the Edikang Ikong soup. You should try as much as possible to make it the only liquid in the soup.</li>
                <li>Add the periwinkle and water leaves and leave to cook for another 5 minutes. You may have to cook for less time at this stage so that the water leaves are not over-cooked.</li>
                <li>Now add the pumpkin leaves and salt to taste. Stir the contents of the pot very well and turn off the heat. Cover the pot and leave to stand for about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Thats it!</li>

                    <p>There are many different ways to cook Jollof Rice. It is a dish made with rice, tomatoes, tomato paste, onions, red bell pepper, scotch bonnet peppers, salt, and spices. If it doesn’t have the above mentioned ingredients, then it’s not true Jollof. I make it the way my mum taught me, and I usually call it Nigerian Jollof because of the type of the rice that is used. Nigerians use the long grain rice that has been parboiled. Other versions i.e. Ghanaian Jollof will use basmati or jasmine rice. </p>
                    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rice</li>
                        <li>Chicken</li>
                        <li>Salt</li>
                        <li>pepper</li>
                        <li>seasoning</li>
                        <li>Dry Fish, Crayfish</li>
                        <li>Groundnut oil</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.</li>
                <li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown. Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.</li>
                <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover, and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid has completely dried up. Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!</li>

                    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Okra</li>

            </div>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice the okra and set it aside in a bowl, the trader in most Nigerian markets can assist you with slicing the okra, but you can also try using a kitchen knife, I like to slice Okra myself, although there is no harm in using the help of the market women.<p>Remove center seeds from the shombo, combine with scotch bonnet and blend or pound using a mortar and pestle. Also, blend or grind the crayfish.</p><p>I used just 1kg (2.2lb) of chicken and 500g of fish for this okra soup.</p><p>I like to parboil meat with lots of spices and then use very little while making the real soup.</p></li>
                    
                <li>Wash the fish/chicken and season with a half teaspoon of salt, two seasoning cubes, a cup of water, and half a cup of sliced onions.
                    Allow it to boil together for 10-15 minutes. Remove them while leaving the stock in the pot.</li>
                <li>Add the stockfish to the boiling pot, one more cup of water, and cook for about 10 minutes till they are soft for consumption.<p>Add two cups of water.</p></li>
                <li>Introduce 200ml of palm oil, add the crayfish, pepper/shombo, and salt to taste.<p>Let it boil for 8 minutes. Add the cooked chicken/fish and allow simmering for three more minutes.</p></li>
                <li>Add the sliced okra and stir. Drop the cooked mackerel fish on top.<p>Allow simmering for 3-4 minutes, and you are done with this delicious soup.</p><p>You can serve ofe okro with eba, fufu or pounded yam.</p></li>
